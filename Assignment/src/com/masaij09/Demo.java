/* Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java at class level ?
 * 
 * ans:
 * Java does this to avoid the Ambiguity while doing the same.
 * like if a class is inheriting  2 different classes and both the classes have a common method,
 * then the compiler will be confused on which method to be inherited, this is avoided in java;
