    Multiple inheritance in Java and why is it not allowed ?
    > Inheriting the properties of more than one class into a single class is known as multiple inheritance.
    i.e A class tries to extend from 2 different classes
    It is mot allowed in java because there might be instances where there might be methods with same name in the 2 parent classes,
    and this might create a confusion on which method to inherit.
    So it is not allowed in java, but some OOP languages lik C++ allows the same.
