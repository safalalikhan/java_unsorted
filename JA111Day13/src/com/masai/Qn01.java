	 * Dynamic Polymorphism and Dynamic Binding :
	 * 
	 * Dynamic polymorphism is deciding to call the overridden methods at runtime.
	 * Achieved through method overriding.
	 * Here, a super class reference variable is used to call the overridden method of child class.
	 * Done using is-a relation by inheritance.
	 * Since the method is decided during runtime it is also called runtime polymorphism.
	 * 
	 * Dynamic Binding is giving the connection of method body and method call, only during the runtime.
	 * It is also called late binding.
	 * When a parent and couple of child class have the same method,
	 * and we call the method using parent reference variable , the type of a particular class is decided,
	 * only during the runtime, here dynamic binding is happening.
